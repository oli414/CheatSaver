**IMPORTANT**: This plugin has now started to become deprecated:
- Since OpenRCT2 develop version v0.3.5.1 (inclusive) 
- After OpenRCT2 release version v0.3.5.1 (exclusive)

The versions listed above will save the settings on a per park basis thanks to the new save format. You will no longer need this plugin to achieve the functionality that this plugin adds.

# Cheat Saver
Are you tired of having to enable the cheats you want every time you start a new park?

Cheat Saver allows you to set which cheats you would like to enable by default. 
You can choose which cheats should be enabled by default by pressing down on the map button in the toolbar and selecting Cheat Saver.

To prevent Cheat Saver from loading in a specific park you can disable it with a checkbox in the Cheat Saver window.
